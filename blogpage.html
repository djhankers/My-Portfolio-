        <h2>My First Blog</h2>
        <p>
          I have no idea what to rant about here but here we go…
        </p>
        <p>
          Hey there, I’m Dylan—funny (at least I think so), occasionally annoying (ask literally anyone who knows me),
          and lowkey talented.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog? Honestly, it started as a mix of “this could be fun” and “I kinda need to do this for a project.”
          But here we are—welcome to my corner of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll be using this space to talk about life, mostly through the lens of my football career. The wins, the losses,
          the pain, the grind, and everything in between. If you’re into behind-the-scenes stuff, random rants, or just want
          to see what it’s like chasing goals (while probably limping a little), you’re in the right place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not here to be perfect—I’m just here to be real. And if something I write makes you laugh, think, or feel
          a little more hyped about your own journey, then this blog’s doing its job.
        </p>
        <p>
          So yeah. Stick around. Let’s see where this goes.
        </p>

        <h2>My Life, in Football Terms</h2>
        <p>
          My life is full of ups and downs (mostly downs) and is perfectly explained by my football career.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was a kid, I played for multiple teams—some even pro! But injuries held me back.
          First, my hamstring blew out. Then my LCL, MCL, and eventually my ACL gave up.
          These are injuries that end most footballers’ careers… but not mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add to that recurring hamstring issues, Achilles tension, a strained right quad, and chronic calf cramping.
          Sounds fun, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          After my big football dreams were shattered by injuries, I held on to the only thing that couldn’t be taken—my love for
          the game.

          Even after all of that, two years later, I am still playing for one of the best cornish teams there is, Goonhavern AFC and even though my injurys are still present, I will
          forever not let these injurys effect my career and enjoyment in football.
